# Turing-machine-tester

Takes in a Turing machine and runs the turing machine on some input string, outputing whether the string was accepted or rejected by the Turing machine.

The inputTM.txt file should have the states (keyword "states" then a comma, then all the states separated by commas)
The first states in the list of states should be the initial state of the TM
Alphabet should contain 1, 0, and delta, or D instead of delta, and should be entered like states, but with the keyword "alphabet"
In the output, D represents the delta character. 
The rules for the machine should be the quintuples with each part separated by comma. You can use delta or D to represent the delta symbol.

The input.txt file should be a one line text file containing the input you wish to test in the turing machine.
